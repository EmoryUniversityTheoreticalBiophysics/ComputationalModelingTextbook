    "# Chapter 1: Introduction\n",
    "Introduction to the Phys212/Biol212 class\n",
    "### by Ilya Nemenman, 2016-2020\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome!\n",
    "This notebook provides the first introduction to the class, and first introduction to Python and Jupyter notebooks. The class textbook by Kinder and Nelson is especially important for this Chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will review the class syllabus and we will answer the following questions about this course:\n",
    " - What is this class about?\n",
    " - What are the class goals?\n",
    " \n",
    "Before that, however, I would like to start with an important note. Learning how to program a computer will change your life. It is not an exaggeration. At first, it will feel frustrating. You will be struggling, not quite understanding what you need to do, and maybe you will even envy some of your peers who were lucky to take programming in high school, or from the CS department last year. You will get a few bright moments, wher something will work, and you will understand how to do things here or there. But overall the picture will be rather bleak. However, as time goes by, and you invest more and more time in practice, the resistance will decrease, and you will suddenly wake up one day realizing that you can make your computer do almost anything you want. You can make it solve equations, analyze data, make beautiful figures, and do other things, such as working with databases, writing web sites, writing medical sowftware, or trading on the stock market. And even if you do not know how to make it all happen, you certainly know the direction of where to search for youranswers, and from that point on, you know how to Google your way to the solution. This will be a very powerful feeling! \n",
    "\n",
    "I have taught this class many times by now, and every year I get some student evaluations which go on and on how this was the most different class of their college career, how the writer of the evaluation felt lost for most of the semester, and how they believe they did not learn anything. One of the harshest such examples was an evaluation I got from a student after my second time teaching the class -- which was, non-coincidentally, the first time teaching it based off my own lecture notes. And then over a year later a small miracle happened. I was walking cross-campus, from my physics office to my biology one -- the walk I often make multiple times a day. And I was stopped by a young man, who looked familiar. He introduced himself as my former student, and said that he wanted to apologize that he had written an especially harsh faculty evaluation. Apparently, he recently had found his dream job as a research scientist at the Center for Disease Control, which involved a lot of scientific programming. And the class was instrumental in helping him get the job. He felt so overwhelmed that not only he apologized, but he wrote to the Department Chair with a similar apology and suggested that all students graduating with a biology major should be made to go through the Computational Modeling class. Another miracle was that the same story repeated with yet another student a year later. I hope, it will be the same for you and that this class will contribute to transforming the way you interact with computers, will change how you think about science, and will help you with whatever you decide to do after college. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I emphasize again: it will be hard! But if you invest the time, do every exercise that I require from you in class or during the labs, do every problem from the *Tutorial* by Kinder and Nelson, and invest time in reports, then it will work. That is, you will come out of this class knowing the basics of scientific programming, programming in Python, and ready to learn other computer languages and do more complicated scientific analyses, which you will be exposed to in the following years of your college career. Investing time early and often, and trying every exercise I ask you to do is key. *It will save you time in the long run!* There is nothing more frustrating when taking a class than finding out towards the end of the semester that you missed something important in the begininning. Treat this class as a combination of a physics class and a language class: you cannot learn a language without practicing it, and you cannot understand the concepts without seeing many specific instances of them. You will need to do both to do well here!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use these notebooks\n",
    "The class consists of six notebooks (introduction and five modules), which parallel our lectures, have exercises that we explore in class, additional homework problems, texts of possible major projects (you will need to do one per module), templates for your reports, and so on. Most of your reports will consist from editing the notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the notebooks alone will be insufficient for you to learn Python. They focus more on the science, on scientific computing, but not on Python per se. For that, we have the exceptional *A Student's Guide to Python for Physical Modeling* by Kinder and Nelson, which you have to read on your own, and execute all exercises from during your Lab sessions. I will call to the Guide on multiple occasions from the notebooks, but will not repeat information from there in the notebooks. Think of the Guide as teaching you Python (which we largely do during the Labs), and the notebooks as teaching you how to use Python to solve science problems (which we will largely cover in the main class). Only by working with the two in parallel will you be able to learn everything that this class is designed to teach you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks have notes, executable pieces of code (which you should execute!), unfinished pieces of code and assignments (which you should complete), references to other web sites and books, and so on. Most of the information in the notebook we will cover in class. However, there will be two types of section that we will not cover:\n",
    " - *Your turn* sections contain exercises, which you should complete on your own, during in-class coding sessions, labs, or at home.\n",
    " - *Track 2* sections contain information that can be omitted in the first reading. However, if you are a science geek, like myself, then you may want to read those sections as well, some of them are fun (at least I think so)."

    "## What is computational modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empiricism and mathematics\n",
    "Western science has been established over the centuries based on various versions of the philosophy of **empiricism**, dating back to at least Francis Bacon. Roughly speaking, science works by making observations about the world; these observations are called *experiments*. One then makes *generalized inferences* from those observations, called theories, which allow making predictions about outcomes of experiments we have not yet done. These predictions are then compared to results of new experiments. Our generalizations continue to stand as long as their predictions are empirically verified. However, if empirical facts contradict predictions, then the theories are wrong and need to be modified. There are, of course, complications related to the fact that experiments also may have errors, giving rise to the well-known adage that big claims require big evidence. However, the overall experiment-theory-prediction-experiment loop is a good starting point for this discussion/ \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been understood similarly for centuries, at least since the time of Galileo's famous phrase that \"the book of Nature is written in the language of mathematics\" that mathematics plays a big role in this enterprise. First, the only thing we can compare are numbers. We cannot compare an apple to an orange, but we can compare their weights (numbers), their colors (numbers representing intensities of various spectral lines), their chemical composition (again, numbers), their shapes and sizes (also numbers), and so on. Similarly, to say that a prediction is supported or not supported by an experiment, one must express the predictions and the experimental data in terms of numbers (binary, integer, real-valued, etc.) and compare the two. And numbers are in the domain of mathematics, which is the first way that mathematics enters science. Secondly, mathematics is a language for operation with abstract quantities, of which numbers are just one example. The language is useful because it affords brevity and, if handled properly, does not make room for misinterpretations. It is thus the language that we use to write down generalizations from our experiments, and to make predictions of future observations. For example, the Newton's second law of motion $${\\mathbf F}=m{\\mathbf a}$$ is a succinct way of writing that *Each body is characterized by a single number, the mass. Then the rate of change of the rate of change of the position of a body in space depends on effects of other bodies, such that the effect is smaller if the mass is larger.* Solving this equation -- which also can be expressed as long, convoluted English sentences, but is deceptively simple in the language of math -- now can be used to make predictions about trajectories of any body with a known mass, as long as we know what the forces are created on it by the other bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of this, since its early days, science has always involved two complementary approaches: experimentation (gathering new data) and mathematical theory (generalizing from them and making predictions). In some disciplines, such as physics, the importance of the two approaches has been well understood for centuries, and traditional curricula have been built to train students to learn the tools of the trade in both the experimental and the theoretical domains. Other disciplines, such as biology, have consciously cultivated themselves as a refuge from mathematics. But this was disingenuous, to say the least: the most important work in biology has been explicitly influenced by mathematics. Examples include development of Darwin's ideas, which were to a large extent influenced by earlier mathematical work of Malthus on population growth. More recently, the foundational Nobel prizes in biology, such as the Hodgkin-Huxley studies of action potential generation in neurons, Luria and Delbruck proof that evolution proceeds the Darwinian (rather than Lamarckian) route of accumulation and natural selection of random mutations, and the celebrated Watson-Crick reconstruction of the structure of the DNA, are all heavily mathematical pieces of work. And now, when biological experiments have finally started to measure precise real numbers, rather than vague trends, the culture of refuge from math is very quickly disappearing, and many of us (myself included) have made their careers on analyzing living systems using mathematical approaches. Other disciplines sit on this spectrum somewhere in-between biology and physics. For example, chemistry has turned into a mathematical science since the advent of quantum mechanics, and social sciences are following the trend now, in the era of Big Data. All in all, you cannot be a research scientist nowadays anywhere in the natural sciences domain (and, to some extent, also in the social sciences) without recognizing the importance of math and having the necessary capacity to do it."

    "### The third pillar of science: computing\n",
    "However, something else happened additionally in the last about fifty years, which has completely changed how science is done, and this was the appearance and ubiquitous availability of digital computers. Instead of a two legs of theory and experiment, science has now become a three-legged stool, supported additionally by computation. Computational modeling is not quite theory and not quite experiment, but combines features of both, and additionally contributes its own. We can use computation as a way of speeding up theory -- computers are faster than humans are in transforming numbers. Thus we can use computers to calculate predictions of our theories very quickly and efficiently. For example, a few years ago, physicists at CERN, a particle physics laboratory on the outskirts of Geneva, reported discovery of the Higgs boson, the last missing component of what is called the Standard Model in particle physics, the theory of the subatomic world. The way they made the detection was by comparing findings of their experiments to thousands of random realizations of solutions of equations of the Standard Model, done by fast computers, and then by identifying which specific Standard Model parameters agreed with the data the best. Similarly, when scientists at Los Alamos National Lab study interactions between HIV viruses and the human immune system, they verify which of their theories of immune dynamics are correct by comparing computer-generated predictions to experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way of using computational modeling is as a fast way of doing experiments. For example, we may understand quite well the microscopic laws that govern interactions among individual amino acids in a protein, or between molecules in a glass. However, some of the important goals of these fields have been the discovery of phenomenological, coarse-grained laws, that either describe the equation of state for the glass, or the sequence-structure-function relation in proteins. Some experiments are very hard to do (for example, relaxation of glass to thermal equilibrium may take many millions of years). Here's where computation helps again. We can run a *digital*, *in silico* experiment using computers reasonably cheaply both in terms of time and actual financial resources. And then any putative phenomenological theory can be contrasted against findings of such computer experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is the introduction into this new and exciting way of doing science: **computational science**. We will learn some basics of how to build mathematical models, how to implement them using computers, how to solve them, and how to make conclusions based on them. There are three goals that I have for the students in the class:\n",
    "\n",
    " - To learn to translate a descriptive problem of a natural phenomenon into a mathematical / computational model.\n",
    " - To learn how to solve such models using computers, and specifically using the Python programming language. This includes learning how to verify that the solution you produced is a correct solution.\n",
    " - To learn some of the most basic algorithms used in computational science.\n",

    "## What is a model?\n",
    "Before talking in detail about computational modeling in science, the first question we need to address is: *What is a model?* \n",
    "\n",
    ">### <font color=red>Model </font>\n",
    "<font color=red>A model in science is a simplified representation of a phenomenon, a system, or a process being studied.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically we build models because their simplified structure makes it easier for us to comprehend them, to analyze them, and to make predictions about how they will respond in yet un-tested scenarios compared to doing the same for the true system. In many respects, everything that you have learned about the scientific method in high school is wrong, or, at best, misleading: science is not about hypothesis testing. Science is about building, verifying, and improving models of Nature. (There is a great short recent article on this topic, which I encourage you to read __[Don’t You Dare Try to Teach Science Without Building Models](https://www.wired.com/2017/01/dont-dare-try-teach-science-without-building-models/)__. A globe is a model of the Earth. A double helix is a model of DNA. Newton's Second Law is a model of how material bodies affect each other. And a mouse, a fly, or an yeast are models of various aspects of human biology.\n",
    "\n",
    ">### Your turn 1.1\n",
    "Give three examples of system-model pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is a good model?* There is no unique answer to this question. Is Newton's Second Law a good model of interactions among bodies? It is an absurdly good model for the world we experience daily, which exists on scales of meters, kilograms, and seconds. But as soon as velocities become large (comparable to the speed of light), or masses become atomic or smaller, then the Second Law ceases being a good model, and relativistic equations of motion, or Schroedinger's equation of quantum mechanics are needed. Similarly, a mouse is a good model of a human when we talk about basic cellular processes, but few would argue that it is a good model of higher level human cognition (indeed, unlike you, no mouse outside of *The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy* Universe will ever be able to read and comprehend this text). The upshot of this is that the quality of the model is determined by the question this model was designed to answer. The same model can be good in one context, and bad in another. The quality of the model is thus determined by comparing its predictions to those of experiments on a *real system* within the specific context of questions that this model is supposed to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    ">### Your turn 1.2\n",
    "For the examples you gave above, discuss when the model is good and when the model is bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different kinds of models: physical models, material models, animal models, conceptual models, and many others. For example, a double helix is a model of DNA. A mouse is a model of some physiological processes in a human. However, in this class, we will talk about **mathematical** and **computational** models only, but all of the considerations above (and many from below) apply to many other kinds of models as well."

    "## Steps in the computational model-building process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of a problem \n",
    "Here, by reading assignments, literature, or talking to your colleagues/users, you get answers to the following questions. What is the question being asked? Why is this an interesting question? What is known about the problem and the answer? What form is the answer expected to be in? You often need to slightly rephrase the question being asked as a result of this analysis, making it more precise and focused. You also figure out which kind of information you need in order to solve the problem, and what is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model development/formulation\n",
    "This step involves translating the problem into an actual mathematical model. It consists of the following sub-steps.\n",
    " - *Gathering relevant data.* Having analyzed the problem (above), we know which data are needed to be able to formulate it. These data need to be gathered from the prior literature, from experiments, or from other sources.\n",
    " - *Listing and substantiating assumptions.*  Models are always *simplified* representations of the real processes or systems, and, therefore, are by definition incomplete or wrong. These simplified assumptions must be listed explicitly, so that we know when to expect the model to be drastically wrong (if the assumptions are violated), or approximately correct (if the assumptions are not violated).\n",
    " - *Determining variables and their units.*  Here we list all of the variables that are either dynamical (changing) or constant, and specify their units. Unit specification is important. Recall the story of the __[Mars Climate Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter)__, which disintegrated in the Martian atmosphere because of inconsistent specification of units of measurements used by different companies responsible for different parts of the mission.\n",
    " - *Determining relation among variables.*  Some variables will be *constant*, and these need to be specified. Other variables depend on the rest by means of algebraic relations, and we will call them *dependent* variables. Yet other variables dynamically change, so that their current state depends on their past state and the current state of other variables; we will call these *dynamical* or *container* variables by analogy with a physical container, amount of material in which depends on the instantaneous flow rate and the amount of material in the past. Specification of dependencies among variables is typically done in charts. In various parts of the class, when we sketch such relations, we will denote constants as triangles, dependent variables as circles, and dynamical variables by boxes. Relations between the variables showing dependences will be denoted by arrows.\n",
    " - *Writing down equations or rules.* Finally, having identified all dependencies, we need to put a mathematical law at each arrow, identifying *precisely* how variables depend on each other\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model implementation\n",
    "For engineering models, implementing a model may involve building objects. For biology, one may need to construct an appropriate genetically modified line of an organism. For computational models, the implementation step always involves writing a program to solve the problem using your favorite computer language, which in our course will be Python.\n",
    " - *Writing the model in your computing language of choice*. Following the discussion on algorithmic thinking, we first write down an algorithm for solving the problem, and write down implementation of the algorithm in the computer language that we use. Needless to say, here we also verify that our program actually works -- that is, executes on a computer.\n",
    " - *Solving the model using the tools of the language.* Different languages will have different pre-programmed capabilities, implemented by previous generations of software developers. It is important to realize which tools are available to us and use such pre-developed tools in our implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model verification\n",
    "This is a crucial step in the modeling process, which is often not discussed explicitly in many textbooks. As an anecdote, I point out that almost every faculty member will be able to share a story with you, which will go roughly as follows. A student spends weeks on coding a solution to a certain problem, and then s/he comes to the professor with the result. It takes the professor just one question, one run of the program to show that the solution is wrong. And the student then leaves frustrated that s/he had spent so much time with nothing to show for it, and feeling very much down about himself or herself because of how easy it seemed it was for the professor to solve the problem. In fact, the professor did not solve the problem. S/he just found a mistake in the student's solution, which was rather easy to do because the solution had not been tested and verified comprehensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We verify the correctness of the solution first by verifying our code line by line, then block by block. \n",
    "However, crucially, we also verify it by testing special cases. For every interesting parameter, variable, or interaction in the problem, there are always **special cases** of values of the corresponding parameters, for which the problem becomes easy (or at least easier) to solve, sometimes even analytically. Or maybe then the problem reduces to a different one, which we already figured out how to solve. In other words, for some parameter values we may know the solutions by independent means. So then one sets the parameter to the special value and verifies if the program outputs the simple solution that we know it should. If it does not, then either our model or its computational implementation is wrong. This process needs to be repeated for every important parameter in the problem before one can conclude that the solution is probably verified and is probably correct. The more independent special cases are verified, the higher is the probability that there is not a mistake in the model and its implementation, and hence the solution can be trusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation and reporting of the results\n",
    "This part of the modeling process will change depending on the specifics of the problem you are solving. However, generally, it involves:\n",
    " - Making plots, tables, or other visualizations of the program output.\n",
    " - Responding to the main question, for which the program was designed.\n",
    " - Discussing if the found solution is what we expected, and why or why not.\n",
    " - Discussing and interpreting the physical meaning of the solution.\n",
    " - Discussing what would happen to the solution if some of the simplifying assumptions get relaxed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a report of the problem solution should follow the same steps as the modeling process itself and should contain *all the same sections* in it. I certainly expect your reports in this course to follow this plan."

    "There are a lot of different computational models that we will be exposed to in the course of this class. And there are even more that we will not be. Generally, such models can be classified along different dimensions. Some specific types of classification for you to keep in mind are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probabilistic (also called stochastic) vs. deterministic models\n",
    "A probabilistic model is the one whose solution involves an element of chance, so that, even if run with the same conditions, detailed solutions of the model might be different in different runs. In contrast, a deterministic model does not have an element of chance, and so the solution is always the same if run with the same initial conditions. For example, modeling motion of a projectile using the Newton's laws would be a deterministic model, while modeling motion of a __[Brownian particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion)__ under the influence of random collisions with molecules of water would be a stochastic model. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static (sometimes also called stationary) vs. dynamic models\n",
    "Static models are such that the variables we study do not depend on time. In dynamic models, the variables of interest depend on time. For example, relations among pressure, density, and temperature in the ideal gas are examples of static models. However, modeling pressure in rising plumes of turbulent air using the Navier-Stokes equation is a dynamic model.   \n",

    ">### Your turn 1.4\n",
    "Give three examples of static and dynamic computational models from physics, chemistry and biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatially extended vs. point (also called well-mixed) models\n",
    "In spatially-extended models, the solution is given by variables (field, as we will call them later) that are different at every point in space. In well-mixed models, a set of variables independent of the spatial coordinates, characterizes the solution. For example, a model to calculate the strength of the electric field around a certain conductor is a spatially extended model; so is the model tracking concentration of chemicals in every point of a cell. In contrast, a model that only focues on the average concentration of a chemical in a cell, and hence effectively approximates the cell as being well-mixed and having the same concentration everywhere, is a point model.\n",
    "\n",
    ">### Your turn 1.5\n",
    "Give three examples of spatially extended and point computational models from physics, chemistry and biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous time vs. discrete time models\n",
    "In continuous time dynamic models, time changes continuously (though on a computer, time is always measured in discrete chunks). In discrete time models, time changes in specific, well-separated steps. For example, a case of a moving projectile is a continuous time model. However, if I were to try to predict where Waldo is every morning at 9 am, then this is a discrete time model. \n",

    "Similarly to the above, a spatially extended is discrete if the space is specified as a lattice, and it's continuous if every point in space can be considered. Tracking position of a human is generally a continuous space model. However, if I am only interested which classroom you are at a certain time, then the position is discrete.\n",

Item 1.C is also problematic: What does it mean to *walk to the door*? How many steps would it take? In items 2.B and 2.C, we are asking to grab the door handle.

    "Our algorithm has already become rather complex. We implicitely introduced a few useful of concepts, such as (i) *states*, which store, or memorize, various descriptions of the current status of the computer, such as whether the door open, which way it opens, how far away we are from the door, which direction is to the door, and so on; (ii) *flow control* -- not every command will be executed in the above algorithm, and some will be executed many times,  and what (and how many times) will be excuted depends on the state of the computer.  But we are far from finished. Each one of the items above may need more information to be unambiguous. How do we look around? How does a door look like and how do we know if we are seeing one? How can I say a specific sentence? If there are desks and chairs on the way to the door, how do we avoid them? How does one make steps? How does one know that one is within an arm's reach to the door? As you can see, each of the steps may take a very long time to unwrap into something that is clear to the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, we are not the first people writing code. And maybe earlier programmers have already solved what it means to *make a step*, and so we do not need to unwrap the program into very detailed instructions that would go all the way to saying which particular muscle fiber needs to be activated when and how much for a step to happen. This illustrates a few key concepts in writing algorithms for solving problems:\n",
    "1. Start with partitioning the problem into a handful of steps or commands.\n",
    "2. Verify if each command is known to the computer. If it is known, then reuse it. *Do not develop this part of your algorithms from scratch!* \n",
    "3. If the command is unknown, break it up hierarchically into smaller pieces, and repeat starting from 2. above.\n",
    "I can't emphasize this enough. Your time is valuable! Do not start with small pieces of your algorithm: in all likelihood, you will soon  realize that you don't need them, but need something else. And do not reinvent the wheel: Use the code that either you or somebody else wrote previously, even if this is not the most elegant solution, unless there's an educational value in writing the code on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, this is reasonably clear, at least theoretically, and you will need a lot of practice to really make this approach to algorithmizing your solutions work. However, a few more things need to be mentioned before we proceed. Usually, the first of the big partitions of the problem is the \"Initialization\" block. For example, in order to walk towards the door, I need to be standing. I also need to know that I am in a building. I need to know that I am not already holding the door knob, and so on. In order to start the execution, the computer needs to be in a well-defined state, otherwise even the most unambiguous commands will be ambiguous. The initialization block achieves this: it sets the states of the computer to well-defined values. Your programs should always start with such well-defined initialization blocks. Finally, as we are developing the algorith, an important step is its verification: how do we ensure that the code we wrote is correct and can be trusted? We will discuss this in Module 1 of the course.\n",

    "\n",
    "Writing computational algorithms should proceed along the same general hierarchical lines as the discussion above. However, there are peculiarities. You should refer to the *Model development/formulation* section above, and here we just notice the following. Before writing an algorithm and encoding it in a computer language, the model building starts first by identifying the things we know, and the things we need to find out in the course of the solution, and listing them clearly. This includes accounting for dimensions of the variables, and for their type: deterministic or not, continuous or not, dynamic or not. I emphasize *dimensions*! This is very important -- at least from my own coding experience, this is where a lot of errors happen. One then specifies how these quantities relate to each other. We usually do this in terms of block diagrams, which we will introduce when we solve our first computational model in the next Module.  After this, we proceed with the usual steps, starting with the initialization step, a few large-scale computational steps, and then the termination/results output step. Then we move to the computational steps and, for each of them, we break it up into smaller pieces, hierarchically, until we arrive at pieces that can be understood by our computer. \n",

    "We will be writing our models and submitting reports in this class using Jupyter notebooks, similar to the ones you are reading now. Appendix B in the Kinder and Nelson textbook has a nice introduction of what Jupyter notebooks are. They are basically lab notebooks for computational experimentation and are a great way of writing lab reports. They allow for easy embedding and execution of Python code, of equations, of external pictures, and of Python graphics output. You may also want to consider reading more about them in various online sources, such as this __[Introductory Jupyter Notebooks Tutorials](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks#introductory-tutorials)__ ."
