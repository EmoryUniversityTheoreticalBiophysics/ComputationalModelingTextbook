For the simplest possible function to optimize, the quadaratic function ${\\cal L}(x,y)= c + a_1(x+b_1y)^2 + a_2(x+b_2y)^2$, where $a_i$, $b_i$, and $c$ are constants, let's optimize it using different methods and compare which one works the fastest, and the most accurate. Use `minimize()` function with different minimization methods __[Nelder-Mead](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-neldermead.html)__ and __[conjugate gradient](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-cg.html)__ and time the execution speed for both algorithms fromt he same initial conditions."

Then use the `curve_fit()` function to fit the model $y=A \\sin ax$ to this data (that is, fit two parameters $A$ and $a$). Explore how the fitted value depends on the initial guesses for $A$ and $a$, and especially on $a$.
